    <h1>HW 6</h1>
    <a>This map focuses on the nativity in California, specifically individuals who are completely native to an Asian country. 
        The data utilized is from 2015. As you can see a large part of California has few native born people. 
        It is important to note that the counties not filled were null data.</a></br>

    <a>The ratio I created was using nativity population (amount of people born in an Asian country) over the total population of each county.
        This shows the percentage of people that are native using a ratio.</a></br>

    <img src="./pb_cali.png" alt="California - Chloropleth Map, Pretty Breaks" width="500px"></a> </br>
    <a>Using the pretty breaks is effective because it has a wide variety of breaks as depicted on the map. 
        The only downfall is that the breaks can vary from a width of 3 to width of 10.</a></br>

    <img src="./ei_cali.png" alt="California - Chloropleth Map, Equal Intervals" width="500px"></a> </br>
    <a>Using the equal intervals is good because it creates equal 4 classes of intervals and makes the data easier to read. 
        It also has a good variety of classes shown on the map. Personally, I see little to no issues with this format of the ratio.</a></br>

    <img src="./nb_cali3.png" alt="California - Chloropleth Map, Natural Breaks" width="500px"></a> </br>
    <a>Using the natural breaks is effective because it has a wide variety of breaks as depicted on the map. 
        The only downfall is that the breaks can vary from a width of 5 to width of 14.</a></br>
